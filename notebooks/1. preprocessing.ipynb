Following that, everything was wonderful for 9 months or so.\\n\\nCrohn's started acting up again at the beginning of this year, and so to reevaluate the situation, my GI wanted a colonoscopy. He ended up perforating my bowel during it! That called for emergency resection surgery to remove the perforated section of the bowel. This time, though, it had to be open surgery. Again, in the hospital for a week. And things have been good since then. The difference now is I'm on Humira; before I was on Remicade.\\n\\nSo to compare laparoscope vs open: I really didn't feel much difference. They say open is a little harder to recover from, and I'd say maybe that's true as far incision pain lasting slightly longer. But the worst part with open surgery is I had to get staples. And getting those friggin things out hurts like a mofo.\\n\\nTL;DL - I had two surgeries within a year, and there really wasn't a problem. You have 6 years (potentially) between yours, so I say you have nothing to worry about. Keep us updated on how it goes!\"]",
