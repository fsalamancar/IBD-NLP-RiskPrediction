Anyway, I've been on the patch for about 3 weeks off and on and at first I thought I had some improvement but I feel like it's starting to fizzle out, but it could be just another flare. Has anyone had any luck or known of anyone who has had luck using nicotine?\n",

      "- Cant comment on nicotine but thc REALLY helped my crohns\n",
      "- I've read a few articles about the effects that smoking has on Crohn's Disease.  My husband was diagnosed a few years ago and smoked for just over 10 years.  With Crohn's it's often considered to be a contributing or risk factor and it also exacerbates the symptoms of the disease for those who continue to smoke.  However, I believe there is research to show the opposite is true for UC.  Non smokers and former smokers are more at risk for developing UC than smokers and I believe there is research...\n",
      "- Smoking cigarettes made everything worse.\n",
      "- I have UC and Crohn's. My doctor actually advised me to smoke cigarettes because I have an aversion to living on pain meds. It was really a damned if you do damned if you don't situation. I can't speak for others but it actually has helped me.\n",
      "- I have been diagnosed with Crohns and UC for 12 years. I smoked for 5 years and quit about 2 years ago. I always had to go to the bathroom after smoking, and feel much MUCH better now that I have quit. It also suppresses your appetite, and I think it's hard enough as is to build up an appetite some days.\n",
      "I've also never heard of a doctor \"advising\" someone to smoke. Crohns puts you at a dramatically increased rate for things like colon cancer, so avoiding cigarettes is probably best.\n",
      "I, too, fou...\n",
      "- Same here. I quit for eight months and felt great. Started back up a month ago like a dummy and I feel a flare coming on.\n",
      "- Agreed. THC helped me put on more weight when I was loosing it like crazy and couldn't eat.\n"
